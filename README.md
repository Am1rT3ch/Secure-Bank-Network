- **Router-on-a-Stick (ROAS)**  
  Inter-VLAN routing via subinterfaces on a single router.

- **DHCP Server Configuration**  
  Centralized IP management using a dedicated DHCP server.

- **SSH Remote Access**  
  Secure shell access configured for remote device management.

- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**  
  Traffic filtering and control between VLANs for added security.

- **Ping Tests**  
  Connectivity verification between VLANs to ensure proper routing.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
